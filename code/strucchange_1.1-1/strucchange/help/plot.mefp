_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This is a method of the generic 'plot' function for for '"mefp"'
     objects as returned by 'mefp' or 'monitor'. It plots the emprical
     fluctuation process (or a functional therof) as a time series
     plot, and includes boundaries corresponding to the significance
     level of the monitoring procedure.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'mefp':
     plot(x, boundary = TRUE, functional = "max", main = NULL,
         ylab = "empirical fluctuation process", ylim = NULL, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: an object of class '"mefp"'.

boundary: if 'FALSE', plotting of boundaries is suppressed.

functional: indicates which functional should be applied to a
          multivariate empirical process. If set to 'NULL' all
          dimensions of the process (one process per coefficient in the
          linear model) are plotted. 

main, ylab, ylim, ...: high-level 'plot' function parameters.
