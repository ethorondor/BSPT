_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes an empirical fluctuation process according to a specified
     method from the generalized fluctuation test framework, which
     includes CUSUM and MOSUM tests based on recursive or OLS
     residuals, parameter estimates or ML scores (OLS first order
     conditions).

_U_s_a_g_e:

     efp(formula, data, type = <<see below>>, h = 0.15,
         dynamic = FALSE, rescale = TRUE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 formula: a symbolic description for the model to be tested.

    data: an optional data frame containing the variables in the model.
          By default the variables are taken from the environment which
          'efp' is called from.

    type: specifies which type of fluctuation process will be computed.
          For details see below.

       h: a numeric from interval (0,1) sepcifying the bandwidth.
          determins the size of the data window relative to sample size
          (for MOSUM and ME processes only).

 dynamic: logical. If 'TRUE' the lagged observations are included as a
          regressor.

 rescale: logical. If 'TRUE' the estimates will be standardized by the
          regressor matrix of the corresponding subsample according to
          Kuan & Chen (1994); if 'FALSE' the whole regressor matrix
          will be used. (only if 'type' is either '"RE"' or '"ME"')

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If 'type' is one of '"Rec-CUSUM"', '"OLS-CUSUM"', '"Rec-MOSUM"' or
     '"OLS-MOSUM"' the function 'efp' will return a one-dimensional
     empiricial process of sums of residuals. Either it will be based
     on recursive residuals or on OLS residuals and the process will
     contain CUmulative SUMs or MOving SUMs of residuals in a certain
     data window. For the MOSUM and ME processes all estimations are
     done for the observations in a moving data window, whose size is
     determined by 'h' and which is shifted over the whole sample.

     If 'type' is either '"RE"' or '"ME"' a _k_-dimensional process
     will be returned, if _k_ is the number of regressors in the model,
     as it is based on recursive OLS estimates of the regression
     coefficients or moving OLS estimates respectively. The recursive
     estimates test is also called fluctuation test, therefore setting
     'type' to '"fluctuation"' was used to specify it in earlier
     versions of strucchange. It still can be used now, but will be
     forced to '"RE"'.

     If 'type' is '"Score-CUSUM"' or '"Score-MOSUM"' a
     _k+1_-dimensional process will be returned, one for each score of
     the regression coefficients and one for the scores of the
     variance. The process gives the decorrelated cumulative sums of
     the ML scores (in a gaussian model) or first order conditions
     respectively (in an OLS framework).

     If there is a single structural change point t^*, the recursive
     CUSUM path starts to depart from its mean 0 at t^*. The Brownian
     bridge type paths will have their respective peaks around t^*. The
     Brownian bridge increments type paths should have a strong change
     at t^*.

     The function 'plot' has a method to plot the empirical fluctuation
     process; with 'sctest' the corresponding test on structural change
     can be performed.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     'efp' returns a list of class '"efp"' with components inlcuding 

 process: the fitted empirical fluctuation process of class '"ts"' or
          '"mts"' respectively,

    type: a string with the 'type' of the process fitted,

    nreg: the number of regressors,

    nobs: the number of observations,

     par: the bandwidth 'h' used.
