_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A generic function for computing the recursive residuals
     (standardized one step prediction errors) of a linear regression
     model.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## Default S3 method:
     recresid(x, y, ...)
     ## S3 method for class 'formula':
     recresid(formula, data = list(), ...)
     ## S3 method for class 'lm':
     recresid(x, data = list(), ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

x, y, formula: specification of the linear regression model: either by
          a regressor matrix 'x' and a response variable 'y', or by a
          'formula' or by a fitted object 'x' of class '"lm"'.

    data: an optional data frame containing the variables in the model.
          By default the variables are taken from the environment which
          'recresid' is called from. Specifying 'data' might also be
          necessary when applying 'recresid' to a fitted model of class
          '"lm"' if this does not contain the regressor matrix and the
          response.

     ...: _currently not used._

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Under the usual assumptions for the linear regression model the
     recdursive residuals are (asymptotically) normal and i.i.d. (see
     Brown, Durbin, Evans (1975) for details).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A vector containing the recursive residuals.

_R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s:

     Brown R.L., Durbin J., Evans J.M. (1975), Techniques for testing
     constancy of regression relationships over time, _Journal of the
     Royal Statistal Society_, B, *37*, 149-163.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'efp'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     x <- rnorm(100)
     x[51:100] <- x[51:100] + 2
     rr <- recresid(x ~ 1)
     plot(cumsum(rr), type = "l")

     plot(efp(x ~ 1, type = "Rec-CUSUM"))
