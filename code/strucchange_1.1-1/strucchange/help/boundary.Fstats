_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes boundary for an object of class '"Fstats"'

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'Fstats':
     boundary(x, alpha = 0.05, pval = FALSE, aveF = FALSE,
         asymptotic = FALSE, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: an object of class '"Fstats"'.

   alpha: numeric from interval (0,1) indicating the confidence level
          for which the boundary of the supF test will be computed.

    pval: logical. If set to 'TRUE' a boundary for the corresponding p
          values will be computed.

    aveF: logical. If set to 'TRUE' the boundary of the aveF (instead
          of the supF) test will be computed. The resulting boundary
          then is a boundary for the mean of the F statistics rather
          than for the F statistics themselves.

asymptotic: logical. If set to 'TRUE' the asymptotic (chi-square)
          distribution instead of the exact (F) distribution will be
          used to compute the p values (only if 'pval' is 'TRUE').

     ...: currently not used.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     an object of class '"ts"' with the same time properties as the
     time series in 'x'

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'Fstats', 'plot.Fstats'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     ## Load dataset "nhtemp" with average yearly temperatures in New Haven
     data(nhtemp)
     ## plot the data
     plot(nhtemp)

     ## test the model null hypothesis that the average temperature remains
     ## constant over the years for potential break points between 1941
     ## (corresponds to from = 0.5) and 1962 (corresponds to to = 0.85)
     ## compute F statistics
     fs <- Fstats(nhtemp ~ 1, from = 0.5, to = 0.85)
     ## plot the p values without boundary
     plot(fs, pval = TRUE, alpha = 0.01)
     ## add the boundary in another colour
     lines(boundary(fs, pval = TRUE, alpha = 0.01), col = 2)
