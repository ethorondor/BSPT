_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Generates a factor encoding the segmentation given by a set of
     breakpoints.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     breakfactor(obj, breaks = NULL, labels = NULL, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     obj: An object of class '"breakpoints"' or '"breakpointsfull"'
          respectively.

  breaks: an integer specifying the number of breaks to extract (only
          if 'obj' is of class '"breakpointsfull"'), by default the
          minimum BIC partition is used.

  labels: a vector of labels for the returned factor, by default the
          segments are numbered starting from '"segment1"'.

     ...: further arguments passed to 'factor'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A factor encoding the segmentation.
