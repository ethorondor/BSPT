_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes boundary for an object of class '"efp"'

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'efp':
     boundary(x, alpha = 0.05, alt.boundary = FALSE,
        functional = "max", ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: an object of class '"efp"'.

   alpha: numeric from interval (0,1) indicating the confidence level
          for which the boundary of the corresponding test will be
          computed.

alt.boundary: logical. If set to 'TRUE' alternative boundaries (instead
          of the standard linear boundaries) will be computed (for
          Brownian bridge type processes only).

functional: indicates which functional should be applied to the
          empirical fluctuation process. See also 'plot.efp'.

     ...: currently not used.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     an object of class '"ts"' with the same time properties as the
     process in 'x'

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'efp', 'plot.efp'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     ## Load dataset "nhtemp" with average yearly temperatures in New Haven
     data(nhtemp)
     ## plot the data
     plot(nhtemp)

     ## test the model null hypothesis that the average temperature remains constant
     ## over the years
     ## compute OLS-CUSUM fluctuation process
     temp.cus <- efp(nhtemp ~ 1, type = "OLS-CUSUM")
     ## plot the process without boundaries
     plot(temp.cus, alpha = 0.01, boundary = FALSE)
     ## add the boundaries in another colour
     bound <- boundary(temp.cus, alpha = 0.01)
     lines(bound, col=4)
     lines(-bound, col=4)
