Bayesian Sequential Probability Test (BSPT) is a test developed to monitor structural breaks in linear regression models. One main application is to detect structural breaks in real time.
BSPT.py contains most of the functions used for BSPT.
The simulation study that demonstrate the performance of BSPT is done in simu_BSPT.py.
The paper can be found in the document folder.
