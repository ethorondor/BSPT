Bayesian Sequential Probability Test (BSPT) is a test developed to monitor structural breaks in linear regression models.
BSPT.py contains most of the functions used for BSPT.
The simulation study that demonstrate the performance of BSPT is done in simu_BSPT.py.
In the first part of the model, we will develop the asympototic properties of BSPT.
